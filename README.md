# Install local

Installs npm/yarn packages locally without symlink, also in npm 5. Exactly the same as your production installation, no compromises.

## Getting started

Install with

```bash
npm install -g install-local
```

You can use install-local from command line or programmatically.

## Command line:

```bash
Usage: 
$ install-local                                       # 1
$ install-local [options] <directory>[ <directory>]   # 2
$ install-local --target-siblings                     # 3
```

Installs a package from the filesystem into the current directory.

Options:


* `-h, --help`: Output this help
* `-S, --save`: Saved packages will appear in your package.json under "localDependencies"
* `-T, --target-siblings`: Instead of installing into this package, this package gets installed into sibling packages
which depend on this package by putting it in the "localDependencies".
Useful in a [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) style monorepo.

Examples:
* `install-local`
Install the "localDependencies" of your current package
* `install-local ..`
Install the package located in the parent folder into the current directory.
* `install-local --save ../sibling ../sibling2`
Install the packages in 2 sibling directories into the current directory.
* `install-local --help`
Print this help

See [Programmatically](#programmatically) to see how use `install-local` from node.

## Why?

Why installing packages locally? There are a number of use cases.

1. You want to test if the installation of your package results in expected behavior (test your .npmignore file, etc)
1. You want to install a package locally in a [lernajs-style](http://lernajs.io/) [monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)
1. You just want to test a fork of a dependency, after building it locally.

## What's wrong with [npm-link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)?

Well... nothing is _wrong_ with npm link. It's just not covering all use cases. 

For example, if your using typescript and you `npm link` a dependency from a _parent_ directory, you might end up with infinite ts source files, resulting in an out-of-memory error:

```
FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

An other reason is with `npm link` your **not** testing if your package actually installs correctly. You might have files in there that will not be there after installation.

## Can't i use `npm i file:`?

You could use `npm install file:..` versions of npm prior to version 5. It installed the package locally. Since version 5, the functionality changed to `npm link` instead. More info here: https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/15900

## How to guarantee a production-like install

To guarantee the production-like installation of your dependency, `install-local` uses [`npm pack`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/pack) and [`npm install <tarball file>`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) under the hood. This is as close as production-like as it gets.

## Programmatically

_Typings are included for all your TypeScript programmers out there_

```javascript
const { cli, execute, Options, progress, LocalInstaller} = require('install-local');
```

### Use the CLI programmatically

Execute the cli functions with the `cli` function. It returns a promise:

```javascript
cli(['node', 'install-local', '--save', '../sibling-dependency', '../sibling-dependency2'])
    .then(() => console.log('done'))
    .catch(err => console.error('err'));
```

Or a slightly cleaner api:

```javascript
execute({ 
    validate: () => true, 
    dependencies: ['../sibling-dependency', '../sibling-dependency2'], 
    save: true, 
    targetSiblings: false 
})
```

### Install dependencies locally

Use the `LocalInstaller` to install local dependencies into multiple directories.

For example:

```javascript
const localInstaller = new LocalInstaller({
   /*1*/ '.': ['../sibling1', '../sibling2'],
   /*2*/ '../dependant': ['.']
});
progress(localInstaller);
localInstaller.install()
    .then(() => console.log('done'))
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

1. This will install packages located in the directories "sibling1" and "sibling2" next to the current working directory into the package located in the current working directory (`'.'`) 
2. This will install the package located in the current working directory (`'.'`) into the package located in 
the "dependant" directory located next to the current working directory.

Construct the `LocalInstall` by using an object. The properties of this object are the relative package locations to install into. The array values are the packages to be installed. Use the `install()` method to install, returns a promise.

If you want the progress reporting like the CLI has: use `progress(localInstaller)`; 

##### Passing npm env variables

In some cases it might be useful to pass some custom env variables object to npm. For example when you want npm to rebuild native node modules against Electron headers. You can do it by passing `options` to `LocalInstaller`'s constructor.

```javascript
const localInstaller = new LocalInstaller(
   { '.': ['../sibling'] },
   { npmEnv: { envVar: 'envValue' } }
);
```
